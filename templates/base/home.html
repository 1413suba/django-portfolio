                    <hr>
                    <p>3 months after writing my first Hellow World program on march 26th 2024 (While working
                    in the marketing department) I had conviced my boss to  let me take a stab at building a
                    better version of the outdated laboratory  management system my company was running on.</p>

                    <p>Before I Knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine.
                    My newbie self was now in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and 
                    supporting thousands of clients.</p>

                    <p>From this You'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing 
                    something scary.</p>

                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by
                    piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do.
                    Documentation is just a reference.</p>
